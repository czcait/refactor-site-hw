### Installing

The codes were running fine. I was tasked to find the source code-(index.html and style.css). I was find the semantic HTML elements. The original version was using a lot of "div" for section breaks. Follwoing the"https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp", I modified the each div to the following-"main", "section", "figure" and "aside".

While playing around the webpage, the first link "Search Engine Optimization" was not working. It did not redirect to the Search Engine Optimization portion. I added the "id="search-engine-optimization" ". The link in the header is working. 

Please see below on the all the task completed.
1. modified "div" to either "main", "section", "figure" and "aside"
2. repair the link with "id" to search engine optimization
3. combined the classes with the same css style
4. removed extra repeats
